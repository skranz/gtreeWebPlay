Below is the automatically generated page for the proposer Stage. Press "Edit Page" to open a copy in RStudio that you can adapt and make look nicer. Then save the file and press "Refresh Page".

<h3>proposerStage</h3>
<h4>Player: {{.player}}</h4>


{{actionField(name="offer", label="offer:", choiceLabels = NULL)}}

{{submitPageBtn("Press to proceed")}}

Note: You can add arbitrary R code inside whiskers, like `{{sum(1:10)}}`. You should keep the `actionField` and the `submitPageBtn` but you can adapt its arguments.
